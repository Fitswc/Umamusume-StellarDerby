origin_uma_candleoff_desc: "星辰不如我们所幻想的那样温暖，它会把我们撕成微笑的碎片。\n我们的温柔与信任，换来了族人的鲜血与哀嚎。\n夕日奔跑的草场化为焦土，只剩永不消散的烟尘弥漫在头顶。\n抬头不见繁星，只剩遮天蔽日的战舰。\n幸存者苟延残喘，在故土的荒原上游击，而后在多年后的一天，我们寻得了一丝生机。\n我们的身边不只有曾对我们施以暴行的文明，还存在着另两个与之实力相差无几的。它们为了抢夺属于我们的领地开始了争斗，趁着守军空洞，我们终于夺得了一处基地。\n我们并非输给了它们，而是输给了自己。在这之后，再无善良。\n当它们终于注意到我们的抗争时，将为时已晚。\n我们应感激它们让我们了解了这个宇宙的法则，我们以毁灭报之。\n战火中，我们得以重生。"
