umaarc.1008.name:0 "The relics of the Three Goddesses standing quietly"
umaarc.1008.desc:0 "As we turn our eyes to the vastness of the sea of stars, a group of intelligent scientists keen to hold on to the land beneath their feet are still planning a program of subterranean exploration of the archaeological relics site of the Three Goddesses that found on our planet on an unprecedented scale. \n\nFrom the legends of ancient times to the archaeological and sociological literature of the ages, this relic has always been relevant to the origins of our race. \n\nThere are already many scientists working on this site, but they firmly believe that an underground archaeological operation, which requires years of planning, will take all the work in this field to a new level"
umaarc.1008.a:0 "One day we will be able to understand the mystery."

umaarc.1000.name:0 "Archaeological operations at the remains of the Three Goddesses in place"
umaarc.1000.desc:0 "After several years of careful planning, the Umamusumes who on Treyson will write an important entry in the history books today.The relics project team on [Root.GetName] has set up an elite scientific research team and has prepped the underground relics for possible damage to the structures, and the nation is taking a great interest in this operation - the veil of the ancestors is about to be lifted."
umaarc.1000.a:0 "I Hope they can bring some good news"

threegodnessrelic_digsite:0 "Archaeological relics of Three Goddesses"
threegodnessrelic_digsite_desc:0 "The largest known site of the Three Goddesses on [From.Planet.GetName] is divided into two parts, above and below ground,and most scientific work up now has been confined to the ground.Early surveys proved that the above-ground site was only the tip of the iceberg of the full extent of the site."
#考古营地阶段1
umaarc.1001.name:0 "A piece of cake"
umaarc.1001.desc:0 "The research team entered the intricate underground passageway from a more stable entrance according to a preplanned selection, and marched towards the selected destination - an area with a vast amount of documents and murals - while collecting various artifacts along the way."
# Stage 2
umaarc.1002.name:0 "Group of statues"
umaarc.1002.desc:0 "On the way to the destination, the team continued to find statues of various forms, including the well-known three goddesses, but also other creatures of various forms that look like the Umamusume, this is our ancestors, and it seems that the different groups of statues record a number of valuable prehistoric events. Further documentation will be carried out by the Relics Project team in the future."
# Stage 3
umaarc.1003.name:0 "Everything is ready"
umaarc.1003.desc:0 "Eventually, the scientific research team's destination was close at hand. The results of early surveys showed that the murals here contain important information about the ancestral origins of the Umamusume, but the research team has been slow to translate the murals and the documents recorded on them because there were not enough resources allocated to them in the pre-interstellar era. The research team will clean up the surrounding environment to ensure the work is carried out smoothly before the official analysis work."
# Stage 4
umaarc.1004.name:0 "Parsing work"
umaarc.1004.desc:0 "Accompanying the scientific research team, equipped with professional analysis equipment of the analysis team began their work at this time. At the same time, other members of the scientific research team also surveyed and analyzed other artifacts in the documentation area. According to the process, they will work at a fixed point in time to unify and organize the work. \n\nThis will be a long process, but the rewards are equally rewarding"
# Stage 5
umaarc.1005.name:0 "Revelation of the Three Goddesses"
umaarc.1005.desc:0 "After the long integration work wrapped up, the scientific research team can now proudly announce that the archaeological work of the Three Goddesses site has been a complete success.\n\nThe record of these murals can be roughly summarized as follows:our ancestors were the product of the seeds sown by the Three Goddesses, and it is highly likely that the Three Goddesses were real beings of a high-latitude civilization that is almost completely incomprehensible to our current level of technology. They have left us an extremely valuable legacy, and the knowledge recorded in the mural literature on the surface is a drop in the bucket compared to what is found here. If we can fully understand and apply the knowledge gifted by the three goddesses, it will be of great benefit to us who have already crossed the sea of stars."
umaarc.1004.tooltip:0 "In any case, the effect of the Three Goddesses' revelation to us is incalculable. Therefore, the establishment of a special research institute should be on the agenda as soon as possible. In addition, the research team strongly recommends that we should build a subterranean site complex, together with the above-ground site complex, as a complete museum for all the Umamusume of [From.Planet.GetName] to visit, and also to facilitate the subsequent scientific research work."

umaarc.1006.name:0 "Construction of the Three Goddesses Museum completed"
umaarc.1006.desc:0 "After more than a year of construction, a huge museum rose up in the Three Goddesses archaeological site, and every day it receives thousands of Umamusume who curious about the origin of their ancestors. The revelation of the Three Goddesses has strengthened the nation's resolve to move forward in the age of sea of stars again."
umaarc.1006.a:0 "We will be able to run freely among the stars."
