building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_lab:0 "Crystal Carrot Synthesis Lab"
building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_lab_desc:0 "When the scientists had synthesised the crystal carrot thanks to a clever combination of elements, the senior researchers built specialised crystal carrot synthesis laboratories in various regions, equipped with modern equipment of the present era and with the main aim of mass production of high quality."
building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_center:0 "Crystal carrot Synthesis Centre"
building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_center_desc:0 "As scientists have taken the crystal turnip seriously, the technology has been refined and regulations and guidelines have been established for its production. It is no longer necessary to have the assistance of a number of scientists, but only a little guidance for the workers in the crystal carrot synthesis factory, who can operate specialised production equipment for the mass production of crystal carrots."
building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_complex:0 "Crystal carrot Synthetic Campus"
building_uma_crystal_carrot_producing_complex_desc:0 "Once the crystal carrot synthesis plants had become available on a large scale, the synthesis plants in each area were carefully divided and integrated into a complete chain of production in the park. This approach not only solved the problem of the disparate layout of the synthesis plants, but also had a positive effect on the synthesis output of the crystal carrot."

building_uma_modern_carrot_farm:0 "Modern Carrot farm"
building_uma_modern_carrot_farm_desc:0 "Under the trend of modernization, agriculture has also undergone technological changes, which has promoted the process of full mechanization. With today's development, in theory, farmers no longer need to go to the fields themselves. With sophisticated machinery, they can get their own high-quality carrots during the harvest season, and then either keep them for themselves or sell them to higher-level processing factories."
building_uma_advance_carrot_farm:0 "Future Carrot Farm"
building_uma_advance_carrot_farm_desc:0 "It is an experimental farm proposed by several scientists who look forward to the future. While taking into account the practicality and simplicity, it boldly imagines the future architecture and implements the construction project. In its vision, a large agricultural center only needs to be handed over to a small number of technicians to look after and perform regular maintenance, and the rest can be managed by machinery. In the end, this draft born out of fantasy was adopted by the academy, and it will continue to be popularized in the days to come."

They would laugh about it, and afterwards they would say:'We're still a bit far from G1, aren't we? This has become one of the places where the maremma would hang out for a while if they had nothing else to do."

building_uma_core_mining_complex_1_desc:0 "With the idea of conquering the subsoil in mind, the experimental small core drilling facility was developed as a theory by scientists and handed over to engineers to turn the theory into reality. Experiments have since shown that the research is on the right track and that it is capable of breaking through most of the hard rocks and minerals in the earth, but performance and diving depths still need to be further improved. After we have conquered the sky, the secrets of the underground will be fully explored."
