uma_little_event.1.desc:0 "Perhaps because of the latest trend, many of our Umamusume have recently begun to reduce their dessert intake to maintain a relatively slim figure. While dieting is a choice of the Umamusume themselves, some of them have caused some negative consequences by over dieting - such as accidental fainting during training. To ensure the health of the Umamusume, we must respond."

uma_little_event.10.name:0 "Theft of food"
uma_little_event.10.desc:0 "The academy's central granary has recently seen several cases of missing grain in a row, and each time the amount missing was frighteningly large. Strangely enough, however, we have found no signs of food being smuggled out of the granary. Our security office recommended that we conduct an in-depth investigation into this serial disappearance of food."

uma_little_event.10.b:0 "Just a little less food, ordinary"
uma_little_event.11.name:0 "Arrest!"
uma_little_event.11.desc:0 "After a thorough investigation, we finally found the "culprit" of this series of cases - in the granary, we found a reed Umamusume. According to her confession, she was a horse maiden who came to the center from Kurimatsu, but was rejected from all the restaurants and canteens because she was "a little bit too big". Afterward, she was attracted by the scent of food in the granary when she was extremely hungry and stayed in the granary. But our people didn't believe that a mamma could eat food at a rate of 200 kg per day - until she ate roughly 50 kg of carrots in front of dumbfounded investigators. After \n the Umamusume was taken to Central Traincent College for an ability test, and the results of the test shocked everyone there once again. Several senior trainers asked the Academy to place the mare under their names, excitedly promising that this local mare would become a legend!。"

uma_little_event.21.desc:0 "Although the Academy has banned similar ranking competitions, many underground organizations still engage in such activities in places that are difficult to manage. It would take enormous administrative resources to completely eradicate such organizations. However, one of our economists has come up with a brilliant idea:we can open a state-directed quiz program, thus pushing such illegal organizations out of the market through economic means."
uma_little_event.21.a:0 "Disproportionate input and gain, dismissed!"
uma_little_event.21.b:0 "Good idea to send surveyors to collect data and feedback"
uma_little_event.22.name:0 "The national guessing system is completed"
uma_little_event.22.desc:0 "Through the full cooperation of trainers, officials and economists, we have succeeded in establishing a system of direct state race betting. \nThis system reasonably determines the maximum amount of money that users can invest in Umamusume ranking bets each month, based on the actual economic situation of each region and the property status of users. This allows people to enjoy the fun of horse racing without investing too much money. Moreover, all the profits generated by the national betting system will be used to build the infrastructure of each region and give back to the people."

On the planet, we found a man-made house surrounded by a gorgeous garden of daisies. From the photos passed back, it seems that they were well taken care of, otherwise they would not have become such a blooming sight. Some of the botanists saw the photos and spoke up, "These daisies are brand new and have not been found on our planet, please be sure to intervene with each other, we need to get these new seeds!" Their claims are of course not something we can decide for ourselves, and it is up to the owner to take them or not.\nAs for why there are creatures on this planet and what race of creatures are on the other side, we are all unknown. Intelligence officers speculate and analyze:"Maybe it's a planet where people crashed their spaceship here and subsequently lived here." This speculation is reasonable, I think we can try to communicate with each other, and also by the way complete the request of the botanists."

So replied our diplomatic attaché.\nWe learned each other's names, and she was called Seiun Sky.

A long time ago, there was an ordinary Umamusume who was not very talented, but still won quite a few tournaments thanks to her and her trainer's efforts.\n The good times did not last long, the alien invasion drama that appeared in the movie happened on their planet, her home was destroyed, her partner was slaughtered, and her trainer died in the battle.\nIn desperation, she prayed to the Three Goddesses, and her prayer was not something to destroy the aliens, her wish was simple, she just wanted to be with the trainer, to train together, and the Three Goddesses §Y really came down §!, they whispered to me, the trainer did not really die, and its soul §Y returned to the Three Goddesses §!, heading for the next leg of the journey."

The rest of her, after understanding the experience, voluntarily fused their souls with her after ending their lives and became the helper to fulfill her wishes. She is Nice Nature.\nAnd now, Our trip seemed like §R Close to the end§!."

uma_shop_center.114.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer stops pointing at“§YFleet Tactics Manual§!”At the same time, Miss Tazuna takes out a book from somewhere and puts it in your hand.

uma_shop_center.115.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.115.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".After taking a look, Miss Tazuna takes you to a mysterious room.\nInside the room, a Rubik's cube-shaped object hovers quietly in the center, splashing a light blue glow around. You carefully touch it with your hand, but you find that your hand seems to sink into something soft in general.\n Looking at your incredulous expression, Miss Tazuna nonchalantly explained to you.\n"I got this energy block by chance when I was traveling, and although I don't know the principles involved, it seems to be connected to §R a higher dimension§! It is closely connected and draws energy from it constantly. But I don't need that much energy, so I'm giving it to you~"\n So, you contacted your physicist and engineer, and under the guidance of Miss Tazuna, you brought the energy block back to the National Research Institute with great effort."

uma_shop_center.116.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?"。Miss Tazuna waves to you, indicating that you should follow her. After passing through a small corridor, you come to a factory-like building. Inside the large factory, only a machine that you can't name at all stands quietly. Seemingly for demonstration purposes, Miss Tazuna operated the machine and then it quickly ran, producing various things at a speed that defied common sense. Immediately after, she will have looked at the dumbfounded you introduced to.\n"It was an industrial device from §R some lost ancient Umamusume civilization! The industrial equipment, I figured out its operation and construction. Perhaps, you can popularize this machine in your country to produce more goods for the Umamusume."\nYou are busy expressing your gratitude, and then you can't help but look at the machine and ponder."

uma_shop_center.117.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.117.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".So, Miss Tazuna took out from behind... A few seeds?\n"These seeds are high-quality carrot seeds that I collected during my travels; they grow quickly, have a high nutritional content, and yield about twice as much per acre as the average variety." Miss Tazuna explained nonchalantly, "You can take them back with you and remember to keep them carefully.\nYou hold these seeds in your hands and you seem to have seen the wonderful scene of harvesting these carrots in the fall.""
uma_shop_center.117.a:0 "I can't wait to taste the new variety of carrots!"
uma_shop_center.118.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.118.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".While you're still thinking about what this question mark represents, Miss Surugawa has prepared a prize for you this time - a... Kaleidoscope?\nWhen you think this green devil across the table is playing a trick on you, she says, "Please pick it up and take a look." So, you half-heartedly put your eyes on this toy-like device...\n Through the lenses, you don't see the expected colorful patterns, but §R another world§! To your surprise, the world outside the lens also seems to have Umamusume and also Traincent Academy. Only, the horsewomen there do not fly into space like us but focus on learning the skill of running in the academy. In addition, you can even see many familiar Umamusume over there, who still run and enjoy their unique lives.\n It is not until Miss Tazuna gently knocks on your head that you fondly remove your eyes from this kaleidoscope. Only then do you vaguely realize what a breakthrough this kaleidoscope-like device will be able to bring to the country's scientific research."
uma_shop_center.118.a:0 "But, I want to see more..."
uma_shop_center.119.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.119.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".Seeing the pointer stop, Miss Tazuna takes out a small diary and puts it in your hand. You open it for a closer look and find that the diary is a record of a trainer's observations of her digit bearer in a level of detail never seen before. Suddenly, you think..."
uma_shop_center.119.a:0 "This book might be useful as a textbook for trainers"
uma_shop_center.120.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.120.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer points to a silver gate (for some reason, you seem to hear a "dang" sound). In between your gawking, Miss Tazuna has led out of the room a... Umamusume? With her noble aura and beautiful long chestnut curls, you can't help but freeze for a moment.\n"So, as a reward for the lottery, Miss §YKing Halo§! is now your leader~" Although you have a lot of questions you want to ask, but first you must first decide, which aspect of the job you want this new leader to engage in?"

She waved her hand and looked at you in a daze as she greeted you :"Hello, my name is Kitasan Black and I am a Umamusume who likes to sing and perform festivals!" So you immediately averted your eyes from her chest and responded with a flustered "hello".\nYou can feel a surge of warmth as you look into her ruby eyes.

tachyon_coffee.1.desc:0 "While we were exploring a brand new galaxy, our research vessel spotted a shortcut ship. The ship did not have any offensive weapons on board and maintained the standards of a civilian ship. But the standards of our planet's civilian ships do not allow flying out of an unknown system, because the configuration is not sufficient to support such dangerous actions. The only explanation is that the owner of this ship has made illegal modifications to the civilian ship to enable it to conduct space survey operations."
tachyon_coffee.2.desc:0 "After our investigation, they are a couple of scholars, which was done through legal procedures and has legal benefits. They have both been engaged in research fields, one specializing in medicine and science, etc.; one specializing in humanities, and have a high level of discourse in their respective fields. They are both senior intellectuals in our country, so why are they here?\nAgnes Tachyon was the head of the Faculty of Medicine of the National University of Traincent and a member of the National Council for Scientific Research, working to promote Umamusume logistics maintenance and medical security policies and actively speaking out in the field of Umamusume factor research. In recent years, however, he has suddenly resigned from all his positions to live with his wife, Manhattan Cafe.\nManhattan Cafe is a linguist, specializing in ancient languages. She is an unquestionable titan in the field of ancient language archaeology. She also worked at the same school as her husband, Agnes Tachyon, and also resigned from her job in recent years, and those who are familiar with them do not know what the reason is.\nBut now that we may be close to the truth, let's see what they plan to say to us."

tachyon_coffee.20111.desc:0 "As you can see, we are surveying this galaxy. Occasionally, if we find some traces on a planet, we land on it to do some archaeological research on the possible existence of ancient relics, and I am responsible for translating ancient texts for my husband. We have no other intentions."
tachyon_coffee.20112.desc:0 "I have also advised her to go to the preparation, let her go to the outer galaxy to lead a team to do research. But she is not, perhaps too much trouble with the process, think there are others the can not be free, so we took their savings over the years to modify the ship out on their own. Originally she also felt that it would not be discovered. Now if she is awake, she must be shocked, and then quickly start space transition to escape."
tachyon_coffee.20113.desc:0 "I'm evaluating your attitudes."
tachyon_coffee.20121.desc:0 "Since this is what she wants to do, I as a wife must support her ...... At first, she still hid from me that she wanted to go by herself, I forced her, and she took me with her in the end. After all, if there is no me, who will take care of her? And she does not know ancient writing, so go to archaeology part-time is two eyes and a black, she will certainly have to run back into the dust and begged me to go with her. She can't leave me ......"

Yes, she's spontaneous at times and it's entirely possible that she might say something like that with a playful attitude. But as long as she hasn't said that, we will probably continue."
tachyon_coffee.20141.desc:0 "It wasn't really a great reason, just a sudden decision made by my husband's head.\nMy husband was ostracized by his colleagues at the Academy of Sciences to which he belonged because my husband had made critical comments on some people's academic papers, which had caused some people to take offense. They deliberately prevented her from publishing her paper, regardless of whether it was important or not. Then, as you know, she resigned and came up with this hot-headed plan:"to go into the unknown without interference".\nThese days, I can see that her mood is also getting better, some of the hot feelings that she once carried when she was young. Of course, she is also very young now."
tachyon_coffee.20142.desc:0 "I don't know the ins and outs of this kind of thing, but my husband is by no means the only one who has left this field because of this kind of thing. I think she has become disillusioned with this environment."
tachyon_coffee.2030.desc:0 "I understand that unregistered ships are not allowed to leave the country's borders without permission, and we will suffer the consequences of that. What do you plan to do with us?"
tachyon_coffee.2031.desc:0 "What? Does this mean that we also own the research ship of the establishment? So what do we need to pay for?"
tachyon_coffee.20312.desc:0 "This is not a difficult condition to accept, as long as it ensures that we can still continue our business."
tachyon_coffee.2032.desc:0 "So, that's it."
tachyon_coffee.2033.desc:0 "Really? Well, I agree with the recovery of the ship, which is to be expected"
tachyon_coffee.20321.desc:0 "As we were preparing to send personnel aboard the other side's ship, at a moment when we didn't notice, their ship disappeared at great speed, and our radar failed to detect their movements as if using some remarkable technology.\nNow we are looking for a ship and two Umamusume in a vast galaxy and it is a needle in a haystack."
tachyon_coffee.20322.desc:0 "The process of recovering the refitted ship went smoother than we expected, and we were able to obtain the ship from its owner, Agnes Tachyon, despite the obstruction we suffered from them.\nAccording to them, the name of the ship is "Argos". It is said that the origin of the name came from a dream at Manhattan Cafe, when it was in the naming period, and I thought it was a good name, so I used it after discussing it with my husband. It is a monumental name."
tachyon_coffee.2050.desc:0 "We learn about the rise and fall of a civilization from this legacy space institute. We are moved by the respect of a once-excellent civilization and their humble attitude toward knowledge. And the "spirit of correctionalism" is something that should be widely studied.\nWhen we look through the documents they wore back, there is no mention of whether the "Tutor" program was destroyed in the civil war, but we might try to find their planet's capital, and if it was not destroyed, then we can take it into our pocket and use it."
tachyon_coffee.2060.desc:0 "I know what you want to do, but you want to use us to find the screening program left behind by the previous civilization, although you do not need to say we will go, not to help you to recover it. I don't know what else you want to do with this thing, can't you see that the last civilization that used this thing died?"
tachyon_coffee.2061.desc:0 "Who can guarantee this? Just based on your family's opinion? I think they must have thought the same thing at first."
tachyon_coffee.2062.desc:0 "What if it's there? If we insist on destroying it, will you kill us to get it?"
tachyon_coffee.20621.desc:0 "It's hard to say! But I can trust you guys for now and work with you, at least until we find it."
tachyon_coffee.20622.desc:0 "I hope you keep your word."
tachyon_coffee.2070.desc:0 "With Agnes Tachyon and Manhattan Cafe running around day and night, we locked in on the site of the former civilization's planetary capital. Surprisingly, the capital was not too far away from us, which was good news and meant we didn't have to compete with another civilization for this archaeological site.\nThis time, the investigation force at the request of Agnes Tachyon is still in charge of the two of them, while we can retain the synergy of the recorder counterparts."
tachyon_coffee.2080.desc:0 "Three of our advance party, Umamusume, succeeded in recovering a collection of books and related cultural objects on the capital of the planet where the former civilization was located. The most important of these was the discovery of the "Tutor" program developed by the prior civilization.\nAgnes Tachyon, holding a small hard disk-like object in her hand, said\n“Because of this little gadget led to the destruction of a civilization ah? I really do not know what to say ...... I also want to study this well.”\nManhattan Cafe stood beside Agnes Tachyon, staring at the small object in her hand and wondering what she was thinking about.\nThe records officer stood in front of the two."
tachyon_coffee.2081.desc:0 "Agnes Tachyon obtained the program from the Institute and, as agreed, we could not force it out of her hands, but our scientific team and the people involved still reported the hope that Agnes Tachyon would give it to us after she had finished satisfying her scientific desires. Another part of the group, however, is pessimistic about this probability.\nWhile we were waiting anxiously, Agnes Tachyon finally sent us a newsletter request. Our people were ecstatic and couldn't wait to approve the request."
tachyon_coffee.20811.desc:0 "You must have waited a long time for my message, right? Look at you guys, I should have taken a few more days before sending you a text message."
tachyon_coffee.20812.desc:0 "I've studied the program alone, and it's interesting. The level of technology of the prior civilization was indeed far superior to ours. I couldn't make more changes to the program, but I was barely able to set certain limits on it, and that's as far as I got."
tachyon_coffee.20813.desc:0 "If the program was mandatory at the beginning, I just set it up to be optional. As long as the test subject does not want to, there is no way to force it. This way I can leave it to you with confidence."
tachyon_coffee.2082.desc:0 "Manhattan Cafe obtained the program from Agnes Tachyon, and then destroyed the program before the two Umamusume could react, even if how sophisticated scientists can not restore it.\n“Cafe……”Agnes Tachyon seems to have something to say, but her word died on her lips.\n“It is too dangerous and I don't want Tachyon or you guys representing the government to get it, please forgive me.”Manhattan Cafe has a determined face and seems to have the courage to die together.\nThe program has been destroyed, even if you want to censure a few words, it is no longer helpful."
tachyon_coffee.20831.desc:0 "Before Agnes Tachyon and Manhattan Cafe could react, the recorder quickly removed the pistol from his waist and fired at the two women.\nThe records officer's task from the beginning is to monitor and assist them, but certain measures can be taken to achieve the purpose when necessary, and this is such a moment.\nShe is carrying a special government pistol, the bullets used will not kill people, the recording officer aimed at non-lethal parts, although not fatal, the severe pain can make them both lie on the ground for a while.\nThe recording officer quickly approached Agnes Tachyon, took the "Tutor" program out of her hands and left."
tachyon_coffee.20832.desc:0 "As our recorder was about to take the pistol out of his waist and shoot the two men, Manhattan Cafe, as if by inspiration, quickly pushed Agnes Tachyon out of the way and leaned down, rushing at the recorder with great speed, striking him with an elbow to the arm before he could turn his gun, causing the pistol to come off, and then following up with a whip kick that knocked him to the ground.\nThe record officer was knocked out, and it all seemed to happen in a moment. Agnes Tachyon also looked at Manhattan Cafe in a trance, somewhat unsure of what to do. Not waiting for Agnes Tachyon to slow down, Manhattan Cafe quickly took her hand and left. At the same time took away the "Tutor" program."
tachyon_coffee.2091.desc:0 "I thought you would keep your word, but I didn't think you would still do such a despicable thing ...... you will regret it"
tachyon_coffee.2092.desc:0 "Once upon a time I never believed in the "revelation" that I happened to have, but I never thought it would save our lives this time thanks to it instead, which convinced me of it. Please wait, waiting for your punishment for breaking the spirit of the contract."
tachyon_coffee.2100.desc:0 "Tachyon and Cafe have been providing us with survey information from unknown galaxies in recent years, and the reports that have been submitted are legendary, like romantic epics from the early days.\n Of course, it was clear to the reviewers receiving these reports that some of them must have been written by Agnes Tachyon, who always likes to exaggerate some details, which somewhat makes the reviewers laugh and cry.\nWe thought that we could try to contact them now and ask them if they have temporarily put aside their work in the field of surveying and return home to continue their scientific work. We could tell them how much we need their talents right now. But we had doubts about whether they would give up their interest."
tachyon_coffee.2101.desc:0 "I don't know what time it is on your side of the world, but anyway, good morning, what did you come to see me about? My schedule can be very tight."
tachyon_coffee.21010.desc:0 "Okay, I'm waiting for your final decision"
tachyon_coffee.2102.desc:0 "If you promise to make me the chairman of the scientific research council, I will promise you."
tachyon_coffee.21021.desc:0 "OK, then I'll be back as President for a while."
tachyon_coffee.21022.desc:0 "With the return of renowned scientist Agnes Tachyon, the entire academic community was in an uproar. And even more surprisingly, the government's appointment of Agnes Tachyon as the permanent president of the National Council for Scientific Research a few days later stirred up a flurry of controversy.\nSome of the collectives of the academy that had sidelined others and deliberately refused to adopt other scientists' reform proposals quickly dispersed after Agnes Tachyon took office.\nAgnes Tachyon has since made many changes to the Research Council that are attracting more and more young scientists. The overall level of our scientific research is also gradually increasing."
tachyon_coffee.2103.desc:0 "Thank you, I thought you were an unsympathetic leader. Please don't worry, I may be back in research after a few more years of drifting around."
tachyon_coffee.21101.desc:0 "Hello, I wonder if there is something you want to see me at this time?"
tachyon_coffee.21102.desc:0 "Is that so? Since my husband has returned to his home country to continue his research, I can't be an unemployed person. I agree to your request."
tachyon_coffee.21103.desc:0 "Manhattan Cafe, a former professor of linguistics at the Department of Foreign Languages at National Traincent University, was recently announced by the government as the country's foreign minister.\nThanks to his excellent linguistic talent and clever speech and discourse skills, our country's foreign discourse is growing and more and more countries are signing a series of reciprocal treaties with us, thanks to Manhattan Cafe's dedicated work in diplomatic matters.\nWe believes that we will face more diplomatic difficulties in the future, and we will have to rely on Manhattan Cafe's ability."
tachyon_coffee.2021.desc:0 "Agnes Tachyon was born peacefully in the Agnes family, it is said that the generations above her is a considerable lineage, but since early childhood, she is not interested in this, she will be the center of her life completely placed in some outsiders seem to be quite fantastical scientific research, but also, therefore, left behind a lot of common sense, many times by the same family of Agnes Digital help and accompanied, finally she went to school in peace. But under Digital's constant pampering, she became more and more difficult to deal with the things of life.\n Tachyon had some problems with her behavior that was unpleasant to others around her. When she was young, she did not care much about the feelings of others, for example, she would openly point out the mistakes of her professors during lectures without showing any mercy, often making them feel uncomfortable, or she did not care much about the environment. Therefore, most of the people who have dealt with her will first affirm her talent and achievements in academics and research, but then also sharply point out her impolite personality.\n This did not improve until she started growing up and met Manhattan Cafe. Although she still retains a lot of her "dashing" personality.\nTachyon entered National Traincent University at the age of fourteen, skipping the junior and senior sections. When she was asked by both Tresen Academy and the Sai Umamusume Association if she wanted to become a Sai Umamusume, she replied.\n“I'm sorry, but I want to fight for a more idealistic field and everything in our future, not to run on the field and then sing and dance on stage. And I don't expect to be in college for long, there are still some urgent things waiting for me to solve.”\nThe reason for her refusal was true as stated above, but she also had health problems. She knew early on about her leg problems and knew that even if she debuted as Umamusume and won a few races by strength or by fluke, that would be it, her racing career was not destined to be too long or too shiny, leaving only a reverie of "what if". So she simply stopped wasting much time and devoted herself to her studies and research. So she made a compromise, too. Outside of science, she is still studying medicine and plans to make her contribution to the medical care of Umamusume in the future. She hopes that Umamusume who are born with poor conditions like herself will be able to run long and happily; that Umamusume who suffer from setbacks and injuries will also be able to receive medical treatment and not have their careers end prematurely or end their lives due to injuries or illnesses as well.\nThis is what she said after her heart-to-heart with Manhattan Cafe. Underneath her scholarly pride, she still hides the glow of an idealist.\nThis is already one of her ideals.\nShe has the ambition to conquer the starry sky with her learning and the exploration of the physical body focused on the earth."
tachyon_coffee.2022.desc:0 "While Agnes Tachyon was eagerly learning about her field, a new face arrived at the university.\nManhattan Cafe started as an Umamusume, studied at Thoreson Academy in middle and high school, and ran in the classics for three years, getting some good results, but eventually got some leg problems and didn't run anymore. After retiring from running, she went to the National Central Traincent University to study linguistics.\nManhattan Cafe chose linguistics for no particular reason. She was not very proficient and insensitive to science studies, so she chose a liberal arts major and came here. Although Cafe has the meaning of "random choice", she still concentrated on her studies, and because of her talent in this field, she applied for early graduation to study at a higher level of study.\nTachyon's encounter with Cafe was during this period.\nIn the lounge of the National Central Traincent Academy of Sciences, where professors and researchers in various fields exchange ideas, there is no telling how many exchanges of ideas and bursts of inspiration have taken place in this uneventful lounge.\nManhattan Cafe occasionally comes here to have lunch alone. It's a bit like an alternative library because the brains of the people sitting here hold an unknown amount of knowledge and an unknown number of books to write down, but it's not as quiet as a library if you happen to run into some scholars having a heated clash of ideas here.\nAnd Agnes Tachyon sometimes comes here with a piece of cardboard, looking for a research assistant. It had some crooked writing on it and some crude scribbles, like the hand of a kindergarten child. The words on that cardboard also read bluntly:\n“I needed an assistant who knew the ancient language and could decipher it.”\nShe did not mention the issue of compensation and was sincere in her attitude when inviting people into the program, but the language was not very appealing to work with. On one occasion she invited a linguistics researcher by saying:\n“Excuse me, I see that you are a linguistics student, and since you can stand here, you must have some kind of excellence. I would like to ask you if you want to delve deeper into it? Although you may be deep in a bottleneck on a project, I will not mind your stupidity, because I have probably learned how to be tolerant of people who are slightly inferior to myself in terms of brains ......”\nAnyway, it was something like this.\nThe ancient language is not too popular here, because most of them will be sent out to do archaeological work somewhere. Among them, in addition to those old-timers, only Cafe is left, so Tachyon also invited Cafe, using excellent words at the beginning, but adding a lot of appreciation for Cafe's achievements, as if she had done some homework after several failures. After listening to her, Cafe did not leave or kick her out as others did, but she was curious about this scientist of her age and asked her:\n“What do you want to get such an assistant to help you decipher? And why do you suddenly want to go into some old stuff? I thought you were all new enough to go for some novelty.”\nTachyon was silent, took off the recruiting sign hanging around his neck, and then said:\n“I don't know, maybe it's a whim. I think I'm going to have to leave here sooner or later, staying here and engaging in some academic politics with some old guys is going to bore me, and frankly, there's no future ...... There may be something out there that I'm looking forward to, but what is it? I'm not quite sure, so I'm hoping to find a companion to find this thing with me. But it might mean that we will be separated from our country, from our families, from ...... Anyway, what's out there is out there, right?”\nCafe laughed, thinking that she did not have the overly precocious and undisciplined look that others had said, but instead had a little childlike childishness and inexplicability, Cafe then replied to her:\n“If I were you, I'd say, 'But we still have each other.'”\nAfter that, Cafe joined Tachyon's personal research group.\nIn fact, Cafe's reply was more or less ambiguous at the time, and when they recalled the memory later, both of them could not help but feel that they were really a bit bold at that time."
tachyon_coffee.2023.desc:0 "Tachyon and Cafe have been active in the Academy as a wonderful duo. They seldom participate in cutting-edge academic research, but only do their own research in their own exclusive labs, sometimes individually, sometimes together; they are always bored in there for days without being seen.\nOriginally, when they first started working together, they always had some small conflicts and friction, but due to their own needs, even Tachyon, who is full of aggressive words, would only complain a few times and then stop talking. And in order to better follow up on the research progress and cultivate a tacit understanding as partners, Cafe also moved into Tachyon's house after a certain project and began to live together. At first, Tachyon was a bit reluctant, she did not want to have someone suddenly come out to control her. But after a while, I don't know how many reasons were used, but in the end, she moved in.\n But even though they are living together, Cafe has the feeling of being a father and a mother. Tachyon's unforgiving mouth, personal habits and eating habits are all things she needs to correct. Therefore, she often wondered if it was a thoughtless thing for her to move in, but after seeing Tachyon's research that she had stayed up for days to finish, the child-like smile on her face, if she left, she would easily lose sight of it.\n From time to time she could see Tachyon with some nostalgic look, and said to himself:\n “You're like Digital.”\nCafe later learned that this was the highest praise for her in taking care of herself.\nThis goes on for several more seasons.\nAs they completed more and more research projects, their rapport grew. Agnes Tachyon was elected by the members of the Research Council to be the head of the medical department of the National University of Traincent because of her outstanding contribution to the medical technology and the innovation of equipment at Umamusume; Manhattan Cafe applied for a transfer to the university to assist Tachyon when she went there. To assist her, she also applied for a transfer and became a professor of linguistics.\nThe lecturers and professors who had taught Agnes Tachyon were overwhelmed when they heard that she was returning to teach. They had all been subjected to Tachyon's scathing comments at one time or another during their lectures, so they had always viewed her in a two-sided light.\nBut the Agnes Tachyon who returned to school did not carry the unruly, unmanageable side of her childhood; But the professors felt her gentleness and humility when they talked to her as if they were standing in front of some gentle scholar instead of the aggressive Agnes Tachyon; they could not believe that the Tachyon in front of them was the same person as she had been a few years before.\nAgnes Tachyon has not changed, but she hides her pride in the deepest part of her being, and can only show it well when facing Cafe. But that humility is not faked, it is unconsciously cultivated in the time she spent with Cafe, and she feels contradictory.\nTachyon also Cafe even works in the university, they are always the same as in the academy when they have time to get together, the tail are eager to wrap around each other, like don't let her leave there for the half step."
tachyon_coffee.2024.desc:0 "Their students always ask them:\n“Professor, when are you getting married?”\nThese words always make them both blush and not know what to say. This gap allows the students to take advantage of the students trying to set them up, I do not know how many times harder than their own studies.\nWhen this kind of talk is too much, one of the two will always think about it, and here it is Manhattan Cafe. She sometimes takes a break and asks Tachyon:s\n“What do you think about it”\nTachyon probably knew what she wanted to ask, but kept quiet, tinkering with his stuff and trying to muddle through. At the end of the day, he couldn't hold it any longer and knew he had to say something, so he said:\n“We are engaged in studying ...... It's not good to make these ...... Influence ......”\nCafe knew she still had some concerns, and did not push her, but only looked at her tenderly, holding one of her hands with both hands, as if all the feelings were poured into it.\n Some days later, I don't know what Cafe did to get her to say yes. The wedding day was set when they first met when Tachyon was hanging cardboard, and they were not particularly serious about their "private engagement" at that time. So they agreed that it was a memorable day.\nOn the day of the wedding, Tachyon looked like a small, disgruntled woman in a deep house. Several makeup artists carefully put on Tachyon's makeup and wedding dress. Although they agreed that Tachyon would be the head and Cafe would be the junior, the wedding was reversed today, with Tachyon as the "wife" and Cafe as the "husband".\nCafe is ready, she put her long hair tied in a beautiful ponytail, wearing a well-fitting black suit, with Cafe's temperament, but also really like a giant corporate chairman, or a mafia godfather. The other side of Tachyon is finally wearing a wedding dress, which is extremely uncomfortable in her feelings, and she can't wait to get it over with and take it off. But Cafe could not let her, she wanted to write down this time Tachyon's look, this is a memory that can be remembered for a lifetime.\nWhen the two were about to take the vow, Tachyon said:\n“This is so you can still cook for me ...... The great compromise made.”\nCafe snickered and replied:\n“If you don't say a serious word, I'll escape the marriage.”\nTachyon seemed to really panic, looking left and right, and finally managed to look into Cafe's eyes, Mumbled the words:\n“I love you......”"

The weirder it was, there was even a plate of raw carrot sticks.\n After investigation, the canteen manager found out the reason:No matter what food was eaten, Oguri Cap's brain waves remained equally excited, so the AI could not judge what kind of dishes should be provided to Oguri Cap.\n The cafeteria manager apologized to Oguri Cap."

So, she applied to the chairman to enter Umamusume's VR server for a visit.\n Chairman Akikawa also readily agreed, but before entering the VR world, the chairman especially reminded the members of the delegation:Do remember that you are in the virtual world. Afterward, the chairman gave Digital and fellow personnel exclusive VR world identities, and the delegation entered Fallen Traincent's VR world—UMA WORLD."

uma_fallen_empire.247.desc:0 "After the delegation entered UMA WORLD, they were immediately shocked by the realism of the world—if the team members hadn't kept reminding themselves that they were in virtual reality, they would probably have felt that the visit just now was just a dream, and this so-called Virtual world is the real reality.\n Afterwards, the delegation came to a huge city, which was not much different from an ordinary Umamusume city, but in the virtual world, the running competition was particularly prosperous. The city's total population does not exceed 20 million, but there are three main arenas comparable to the Hanshin Racecourse, and more than 20 small arenas, large and small, covering grass, sand and classic obstacle courses, with lengths ranging from 1,000 meters to 4200 meters.\n At the strong request of Agnes Digital, she participated in a mud mile race and a grass 2000-meter race, and both won the championship and received applause from the audience —- of course, she fainted peacefully when the other players competed on the same stage.\n After a long day, the delegation decided to log out of the VR world. However, there was a little episode -- a member was too nostalgic for the world in it and didn't want to leave. But in the end, under the persuasion of everyone, she reluctantly left this world."
