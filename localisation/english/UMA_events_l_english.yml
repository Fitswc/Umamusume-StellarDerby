uma_little_event.1.desc:0 "Perhaps because of the latest trend, many of our Umamusume have recently begun to reduce their dessert intake in order to maintain a relatively slim figure. While dieting is a choice of the Umamusume themselves, some of them have caused some negative consequences by over dieting - such as accidental fainting during training. To ensure the health of the Umamusume, we must respond."
uma_little_event.1.a:0 "Developing new desserts and claiming that they don't affect weight and that their needs to eat more"

uma_little_event.3.name:0 "Dieting Education Popularization"
uma_little_event.3.desc:0 "By educating the majority of Umamusume about sensible dieting methods, most of the normal-sized ponies have cancelled their dieting plans. And a few of the fat Umamusume have also developed more reasonable weight loss programs."

uma_little_event.10.name:0 "Theft of food"
uma_little_event.10.desc:0 "The academy's central granary has recently seen several cases of missing grain in a row, and each time the amount missing was frighteningly large. Strangely enough, however, we have found no signs of food being smuggled out of the granary. Our security office recommended that we conduct an in-depth investigation into this serial disappearance of food."
uma_little_event.10.a:0 "Can no longer tolerate, must be a heavy fist!"
uma_little_event.10.b:0 "Just a little less food, ordinary"
uma_little_event.11.name:0 "Arrest!"
uma_little_event.11.desc:0 "After a thorough investigation, we finally found the "culprit" of this series of cases - in the granary, we found a reed Umamusume. According to her confession, she was a horse maiden who came to the center from Kurimatsu, but was rejected from all the restaurants and canteens because she was "a little bit too big". Afterwards, she was attracted by the scent of food in the granary when she was extremely hungry, and stayed in the granary. But our people didn't believe that a mamma could eat food at a rate of 200 kg per day - until she ate roughly 50 kg of carrots in front of dumbfounded investigators. After ,\n the Umamusume was taken to Central Thoresen College for an ability test, and the results of the test shocked everyone there once again. Several senior trainers asked the Academy to place the mare under their names, excitedly promising that this local mare would become a legend!。"
uma_little_event.11.a:0 "I feel that this Umamusume is not ordinary people, let it join us"

uma_little_event.21.desc:0 "Although the Academy has banned similar ranking competitions, many underground organizations still engage in such activities in places that are difficult to manage. It would take enormous administrative resources to completely eradicate such organizations. However, one of our economists has come up with a brilliant idea:we can open a state-directed quiz program, thus pushing such illegal organizations out of the market through economic means."
uma_little_event.21.a:0 "Disproportionate input and gain, dismissed!"
uma_little_event.21.b:0 "Good idea to send surveyors to collect data and feedback"
uma_little_event.22.name:0 "The national guessing system is completed"
uma_little_event.22.desc:0 "Through the full cooperation of trainers, officials and economists, we have succeeded in establishing a system of direct state race betting. \nThis system reasonably determines the maximum amount of money that users can invest in Umamusume ranking bets each month, based on the actual economic situation of each region and the property status of users. This allows people to enjoy the fun of horse racing without investing too much money. Moreover, all the profits generated by the national betting system will be used to build the infrastructure of each region and give back to the people."

On the planet, we found a man-made house surrounded by a gorgeous garden of daisies. From the photos passed back, it seems that they were well taken care of, otherwise they would not have become such a blooming sight. Some of the botanists saw the photos and spoke up, "These daisies are brand new and have not been found on our planet, please be sure to intervene with each other, we need to get these new seeds!" Their claims are of course not something we can decide for ourselves, and it is up to the owner to take them or not.\nAs for why there are creatures on this planet and what race of creatures are on the other side, we are all unknown. Intelligence officers speculate and analyze:"Maybe it's a planet where people crashed their spaceship here and subsequently lived here." This speculation is reasonable, I think we can try to communicate with each other, and also by the way to complete the request of the botanists."

So replied our diplomatic attaché.\nWe learned each other's names, and she was called Seiun Sky.

uma_special_leader.51.desc:0 "Recently, an anonymous author released a racehorse girl love simulation + nurturing game "Koi Derby" (abbreviated as KD) has become popular in all of Thoresen. Unlike the previous nurturing game, this game focuses on the daily life of Umamusume from the point of view of Umamusume, overturning the common image of professional athletes.\nSome people think that this game characterization and plot development is remarkable, the daily life of the Umamusume, training and competition rigorous research, some people think that there are not so many strange things on the professional circuit, accusing its emotional depiction is too "love brain"\n. The author is not yet available."
uma_special_leader.51.a:0 "Is there a mystery code?"

uma_special_leader.53.name:0 "The source of the boom"
uma_special_leader.53.desc:0 "Reports were sent in from all over the country that the reason for this increase in the percentage of willingness to Umamusume was the recent explosion of the game KD, and that some Umamusume longed for the life of a Umamusume and planned to give it a try. \n education departments around the country also commented on this, the vast majority of people think that this matter has improved the student population of Thoresen, but there are a few people think that this will affect the selectivity of the game."

uma_special_leader.55.desc:0 "Due to the influence of KD, the number of people who registered for this year's Umamusume was at an all-time high.

Since the selection is based on the criteria of each trainer, "potential" and "personality" are also important criteria in addition to "strength"."

uma_special_leader.65.b:0 "How about the position of Director of Admissions at Central Thoresen?"
uma_special_leader.66.name:0 "Regulation"
uma_special_leader.66.desc:0 "KD's content will be added under regulation about the boring side of a Umamusume's life to curb this enrollment boom. Maybe this will have an impact on the content, but at least we won't have to be anxious about the overload of enrollment."
uma_special_leader.66.a:0 "Necessary sacrifices ......"
uma_special_leader.67.title:0 "Agnes Digital"
uma_special_leader.67.desc:0 "Well? What do you mean?"
uma_special_leader.67.a:0 "We will try to give you the conditions and resources you need to make this game, but of course, you have to bear some of the consequences, are you willing?"

uma_special_leader.68.desc:0 "Of course! With pleasure!"
uma_special_leader.68.a:0 "Looking forward to your performance (laughs)"
uma_special_leader.69.name:0 "Love All Life"
uma_special_leader.69.desc:0 "The decision took the students' union by surprise. At first they thought the move was to let Digital know how hard the admissions office worked, but as time progressed and Digital became more comfortable in the position, she reorganized the admissions department under her own authority to achieve a more efficient operation.\nShe even had time to run to the playground or student dormitories every day to collect material herself, and although she sometimes made strange noises or was often sent to the infirmary by students, she was still well liked by them.\nIt seems that her talents are not only limited to this."

So, you half-heartedly put your eyes on this toy-like device...\nThrough the lenses, you don't see the expected colorful patterns, but §R another world§! To your surprise, the world outside the lens also seems to have Umamusume and also Thoresen Academy. Only, the horsewomen there do not fly into space like us, but focus on learning the skill of running in the academy. In addition, you can even see many familiar Umamusume over there, who still run and enjoy their unique lives.\nIt is not until Miss Tazuna gently knocks on your head that you fondly remove your eyes from this kaleidoscope. Only then do you vaguely realize what a breakthrough this kaleidoscope-like device will be able to bring to the country's scientific research."
