uma_little_event.1.desc:0 "Perhaps because of the latest trend, many of our Umamusume have recently begun to reduce their dessert intake in order to maintain a relatively slim figure. While dieting is a choice of the Umamusume themselves, some of them have caused some negative consequences by over dieting - such as accidental fainting during training. To ensure the health of the Umamusume, we must respond."

uma_little_event.10.name:0 "Theft of food"
uma_little_event.10.desc:0 "The academy's central granary has recently seen several cases of missing grain in a row, and each time the amount missing was frighteningly large. Strangely enough, however, we have found no signs of food being smuggled out of the granary. Our security office recommended that we conduct an in-depth investigation into this serial disappearance of food."

uma_little_event.10.b:0 "Just a little less food, ordinary"
uma_little_event.11.name:0 "Arrest!"
uma_little_event.11.desc:0 "After a thorough investigation, we finally found the "culprit" of this series of cases - in the granary, we found a reed Umamusume. According to her confession, she was a horse maiden who came to the center from Kurimatsu, but was rejected from all the restaurants and canteens because she was "a little bit too big". Afterwards, she was attracted by the scent of food in the granary when she was extremely hungry, and stayed in the granary. But our people didn't believe that a mamma could eat food at a rate of 200 kg per day - until she ate roughly 50 kg of carrots in front of dumbfounded investigators. After ,\n the Umamusume was taken to Central Thoresen College for an ability test, and the results of the test shocked everyone there once again. Several senior trainers asked the Academy to place the mare under their names, excitedly promising that this local mare would become a legend!。"

uma_little_event.21.desc:0 "Although the Academy has banned similar ranking competitions, many underground organizations still engage in such activities in places that are difficult to manage. It would take enormous administrative resources to completely eradicate such organizations. However, one of our economists has come up with a brilliant idea:we can open a state-directed quiz program, thus pushing such illegal organizations out of the market through economic means."
uma_little_event.21.a:0 "Disproportionate input and gain, dismissed!"
uma_little_event.21.b:0 "Good idea to send surveyors to collect data and feedback"
uma_little_event.22.name:0 "The national guessing system is completed"
uma_little_event.22.desc:0 "Through the full cooperation of trainers, officials and economists, we have succeeded in establishing a system of direct state race betting. \nThis system reasonably determines the maximum amount of money that users can invest in Umamusume ranking bets each month, based on the actual economic situation of each region and the property status of users. This allows people to enjoy the fun of horse racing without investing too much money. Moreover, all the profits generated by the national betting system will be used to build the infrastructure of each region and give back to the people."

On the planet, we found a man-made house surrounded by a gorgeous garden of daisies. From the photos passed back, it seems that they were well taken care of, otherwise they would not have become such a blooming sight. Some of the botanists saw the photos and spoke up, "These daisies are brand new and have not been found on our planet, please be sure to intervene with each other, we need to get these new seeds!" Their claims are of course not something we can decide for ourselves, and it is up to the owner to take them or not.\nAs for why there are creatures on this planet and what race of creatures are on the other side, we are all unknown. Intelligence officers speculate and analyze:"Maybe it's a planet where people crashed their spaceship here and subsequently lived here." This speculation is reasonable, I think we can try to communicate with each other, and also by the way to complete the request of the botanists."

So replied our diplomatic attaché.\nWe learned each other's names, and she was called Seiun Sky.

uma_special_leader.94.desc:0 "让我们从头开始说吧。在很久以前，有一位普通的马娘，她的天赋并不高，但是在她和她的训练员的努力下，还是获得了不少比赛的胜利。\n好景不长，电影中出现的外星人入侵的剧情发生在了他们的星球上，她的家园被毁灭，她的伙伴惨遭屠戮，她的训练员死于战火之中。\n在绝望之中，她向三女神祈祷，她祈祷的并不是什么消灭外星人，她的愿望很简单，她只想跟训练员一起，一起训练，三女神§Y真的降临了§!，她们向我耳语，训练员并没有真正死去，其灵魂§Y回归了三女神的怀抱§!，前往下一段旅途。"

uma_shop_center.113.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.113.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the needle stopped at“§YAncient artifacts§!”.So, you see Miss Tazuna taking a bunch of small objects out of the room and placing them one by one in front of you.

uma_shop_center.113.a:0 "We're going to be rich!"
uma_shop_center.114.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.114.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer stops pointing at“§YFleet Tactics Manual§!”At the same time, Miss Tazuna takes out a book from somewhere and puts it in your hand. The book looks a bit like the textbook used in the Fleet Academy, but the theory and content used is far more advanced than the textbook. You thanked her and took the book back."
uma_shop_center.114.a:0 "This will enhance our fleet..."
uma_shop_center.115.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.115.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".After taking a look, Miss Tazuna takes you to a mysterious room.\nInside the room, a Rubik's cube shaped object hovers quietly in the center, splashing a light blue glow around. You carefully touch it with your hand, but you find that your hand seems to sink into something soft in general.\nLooking at your incredulous expression, Miss Tazuna explained to you in a nonchalant manner.\n"I got this energy block by chance when I was traveling, and although I don't know the principles involved, it seems to be connected to §R a higher dimension§! It is closely connected and draws energy from it constantly. But I don't need that much energy, so I'm giving it to you~"\nSo, you contacted your physicist and engineer, and under the guidance of Miss Tazuna, you brought the energy block back to the National Research Institute with great effort."
uma_shop_center.115.a:0 "Endless energy..."
uma_shop_center.116.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.116.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?"。Miss Tazuna waves to you, indicating that you should follow her. After passing through a small corridor, you come to a factory-like building. Inside the large factory, only a machine that you can't name at all stands quietly. Seemingly for demonstration purposes, Miss Tazuna operated the machine and then it quickly ran, producing various things at a speed that defied common sense. Immediately after, she will have looked at the dumbfounded you introduced to.\n"It was an industrial device from §R some lost ancient Umamusume civilization! The industrial equipment, in the long years, I figured out its operation and construction. Perhaps, you can popularize this machine in your country to produce more goods for the Umamusume."\nYou are busy expressing your gratitude, and then you can't help but look at the machine and ponder."
uma_shop_center.116.a:0 "If one day we can also have such technology..."
uma_shop_center.117.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.117.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".So, Miss Tazuna took out from behind... A few seeds?\n"These seeds are high quality carrot seeds that I collected during my travels; they grow quickly, have a high nutritional content, and yield about twice as much per acre as the average variety." Miss Tazuna explained nonchalantly, "You can take them back with you and remember to keep them carefully.\nYou hold these seeds in your hands and you seem to have seen the wonderful scene of harvesting these carrots in the fall.""
uma_shop_center.117.a:0 "I can't wait to taste the new variety of carrots!"
uma_shop_center.118.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.118.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".While you're still thinking about what this question mark represents, Miss Surugawa has prepared a prize for you this time - a... Kaleidoscope?\nWhen you think this green devil across the table is playing a trick on you, she says, "Please pick it up and take a look." So, you half-heartedly put your eyes on this toy-like device...\nThrough the lenses, you don't see the expected colorful patterns, but §R another world§! To your surprise, the world outside the lens also seems to have Umamusume and also Thoresen Academy. Only, the horsewomen there do not fly into space like us, but focus on learning the skill of running in the academy. In addition, you can even see many familiar Umamusume over there, who still run and enjoy their unique lives.\nIt is not until Miss Tazuna gently knocks on your head that you fondly remove your eyes from this kaleidoscope. Only then do you vaguely realize what a breakthrough this kaleidoscope-like device will be able to bring to the country's scientific research."
uma_shop_center.118.a:0 "But, I want to see more..."
uma_shop_center.119.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.119.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer pointed to a big "?".Seeing the pointer stop, Miss Tazuna takes out a small diary and puts it in your hand. You open it for a closer look and find that the diary is a record of a trainer's observations of her digit bearer in a level of detail never seen before. Suddenly, you think..."
uma_shop_center.119.a:0 "This book might be useful as a textbook for trainers"
uma_shop_center.120.title:0 "Lottery Results"
uma_shop_center.120.desc:0 "You gently turn the wheel...\nEventually, the pointer points to a silver gate (for some reason, you seem to hear a "dang" sound). In between your gawking, Miss Tazuna has led out of the room a... Umamusume? With her noble aura and beautiful long chestnut curls, you can't help but freeze for a moment.\n"So, as a reward for the lottery, Miss §YKing Halo§! is now your leader~" Although you have a lot of questions you want to ask, but first you must first decide, which aspect of the job you want this new leader to engage in?"

Before you can react, another eagle flies out and rests on her shoulder.\n"This eagle is called Mambo, so kindly give us your advice,too" You look at the Umamusume and eagle in front of you, you can not But before that, you have to assign a job to the El Condor Pasa..."

She waved her hand and looked at you in a daze as she greeted you :"Hello, my name is Kitasan Black and I am a Umamusume who likes to sing and perform festivals!" So you immediately averted your eyes from the her chest and responded with a flustered "hello".\nYou can feel a surge of warmth as you look into her ruby eyes.

tachyon_coffee.1.desc:0 "在我们勘探着一处全新的星系时，我们的科研船却发现了一艘捷足先登的飞船。船上并无任何攻击性的武器，都保持着民间飞船的标准。但我们星球的民间飞船的标准是不允许飞出一处未知星系的，因为相关的配置不足以支持这种危险的行径。唯一可以解释的便是这艘飞船的主人对这艘民用飞船进行了非法的改装，使其能够进行太空勘测作业。"
tachyon_coffee.2.desc:0 "经过我们的调查，她们是一对学者夫妻，是通过合法手续办理的，具有法律效益。她们都曾从事于研究领域，一人是专攻医学与科学等等；一人则专攻人文，在各自领域都拥有着很高的话语权。她们都为我国高级知识分子，为什么她们会出现在这里呢？\n爱丽速子曾任国立特雷森大学医学部学部长，同时是国家科研理事会的成员之一，致力于推动马娘后勤维护与医疗保障政策，并积极在马娘因子研究领域发表意见。不过最近几年突然辞去了所有职务，与自己的妻子曼城茶座生活。\n曼城茶座则是一名语言学专家，专攻古代语言。在古代语言考古方面是毫无疑问的泰斗。工作也与其先生爱丽速子在同一学校任职，也是在近几年辞去了工作，连同熟悉她们的人也不知道是什么原因。\n不过现在，我们或许已经接近真相了，看看她们打算与我们说些什么吧。"
tachyon_coffee.2011.desc:0 "向您问好，[Root.GetRulerName]。我叫做曼城茶座，算是这艘船的第二主人。我的伴侣正在与梦貘缠斗着，所以请原谅由我来与您交谈。"
tachyon_coffee.20101.desc:0 "好的，您还有什么疑问吗"
tachyon_coffee.20111.desc:0 "如您所见，我们正在勘测这处星系。偶尔，若是在一颗星球上发现些什么痕迹，我们也会降落到星球上对可能会存在的远古遗迹做些考古研究工作，我负责为我的先生翻译古代文字。我们并没有别的企图。"
tachyon_coffee.20112.desc:0 "我也曾经劝告过她，让她去考个编制，自己领个队伍到外星系去搞科研。可她偏不，或许是嫌流程麻烦，觉得有别人在不能自由自在的，所以我们就拿了自己这些年的积蓄擅自改装了飞船自己出来了。本来她还觉得不会被发现呢。现在她要是醒着，肯定得吓一跳，然后赶快启动空间折跃逃走。"
tachyon_coffee.20113.desc:0 "我在评估你们的态度。"
tachyon_coffee.20121.desc:0 "既然这是她想做的事情，我作为妻子肯定要支持她……一开始她还瞒着我想自己去呢，我就逼她，她到底还是带着我一起去了。毕竟如果没有我的话，谁来照顾她呢？而且她也不懂古代文字，这样去考古兼职就是两眼一摸黑，她到时肯定得灰溜溜地跑回来求着我和她一起去。她可离不开我......"
tachyon_coffee.20122.desc:0 "别人看来是这样的，但她本人倒是不太坦率。"

tachyon_coffee.20132.desc:0 "我不清楚……或许我的先生在未来的几年里或者明天后天就会突然和我说：“茶座，要不我们回去吧？”是的，她有时随性的很，完全有可能抱着一种玩腻了的态度说出这种话来。但只要她还没说出这句话之前，我们大概是会继续下去的。"
tachyon_coffee.20141.desc:0 "其实也并不是什么了不起的原因，只是我的先生脑袋一热突然就做出的决定。\n我的先生在所属的科学院里受到同僚的排挤，因为我的先生曾对一些人的学术论文发表过批评意见，引得一些人的不满。她们便刻意不让她的论文发表，不论这篇文章是否重要，一概予以阻拦。之后就像您知道的事情了，她辞职了，随后想出了这脑袋一热的计划：“不受干扰的去研究未知”。\n这些日子里，我能见到她的情绪也在不断变好，有些曾经她年轻时怀揣着的热情感了。当然，她现在也很年轻。"
tachyon_coffee.20142.desc:0 "我并不了解这种事情的内幕，但因这种事情而离开这一领域的人绝非只有我先生一人。我想她已经对这种环境失望透顶了。"

tachyon_coffee.2032.desc:0 "那么，到此为止吧"
tachyon_coffee.2033.desc:0 "是吗，好吧，我同意回收飞船，这也在我的意料之内"
tachyon_coffee.20321.desc:0 "在我们准备派遣人员登上对方的飞船时，就在我们不曾注意到的一刻，她们的飞船极速的遁走了，我们的雷达也没能发现她们的行踪，就像是运用了某种卓越的空间技术。\n现在让我们在广袤无垠的星系里寻找一艘船和两个马娘无疑是大海捞针。"
tachyon_coffee.20322.desc:0 "回收这艘改装飞船的进程比我们想象中的要顺利，尽管遭受到了来自飞船主人爱丽速子的阻挠，但我们还是从她们的手里取得了这艘船。\n照她们所说，这艘飞船的名字叫做“阿尔戈斯”。据说名字的来由源自曼城茶座做的一场梦，当时正处于命名期，觉得这名字不错便与其先生商量了一下后使用了这个名字。是一个具有纪念意义的名字。"
tachyon_coffee.2050.desc:0 "我们从这所遗留下来的空间研究所中得知了一个文明的兴亡。我们为一个曾经优秀的文明抱有敬意，并为她们对知识的谦卑态度而动容。而“教养主义精神”是应广泛学习的。\n我们在翻阅她们穿回的相关文档中，并没有提及“导师”程序是否在内战之中被摧毁了，但我们或许可以试着去寻找她们的星球首府，如果它并未被摧毁，那么我们可以将它收入囊中，然后被我们加以利用。"
tachyon_coffee.2060.desc:0 "我知道你们想做些什么，无非是想借我们之手去寻找前文明遗留下来的筛选程序，虽然不用你说我们也会去的，但可不是帮你去回收它。真不知道你们还想用这玩意儿来干些什么，没见到上一个用这玩意儿的文明都灭亡了吗？"
tachyon_coffee.2061.desc:0 "这谁又能保证呢？仅凭你一家之言?我觉得她们一开始肯定也是这么想的。"
tachyon_coffee.2062.desc:0 "要是它在的话呢？如果我们执意要摧毁它，你们会不会为了得到它把我们杀掉灭口?"
tachyon_coffee.20621.desc:0 "这可不好说！不过我可以暂时信任你们，与你们合作，至少在找到它之前。"
tachyon_coffee.20622.desc:0 "希望你信守承诺。"
tachyon_coffee.2070.desc:0 "在爱丽速子与曼城茶座日夜奔波下，我们锁定了前文明的星球首府遗址。出乎意料的是，首府的距离离我们并不算太远，这是一个好消息，意味着我们不用再和另一个文明争夺这个考古遗迹。\n这次的调查部队在爱丽速子的要求之下仍由她们两人负责，而我们则可以保留协同的记录官同行。"
tachyon_coffee.2080.desc:0 "我们的三位先遣马娘成功的在前文明所在的星球首府上回收了一系列藏书与相关的文化物件。其中最重要的便是成功的找到了前文明所研究出的“导师”程序。\n爱丽速子手里拿着小小的一块硬盘模样的东西，感慨道\n“就因为这个小玩意儿导致了一个文明的毁灭啊？真不知道该说些什么……我也想好好研究一下啊。”\n曼城茶座站在爱丽速子身侧，盯着她手中的小物件不知道想着些什么。\n记录官站在两人面前。"
tachyon_coffee.2081.desc:0 "爱丽速子从研究所中取得了程序，按照约定，我们也不能强行从她的手中得到，但我们的科研团队以及相关人员仍报以希望，觉得爱丽速子在满足完她的科研欲望之后会将程序交给我们。不过另一部分人对于这种概论持悲观态度。\n就在我们焦急地等待时，爱丽速子终于给我们发送了通讯申请。我们的人员欣喜若狂，迫不及待的就同意了对方的申请。"
tachyon_coffee.20811.desc:0 "看你们的样子，一定等我的信息等了很久吧？瞧瞧你们的样子，早知道就多缓几天再给你们传简讯了。"
tachyon_coffee.20812.desc:0 "我已经独自研究过程序了，很有趣，果然前文明的科技水平要远胜于我们的。我无法对程序做出更多的变动，但我勉强的能够给它设置一定的限制，这是我的极限了。"
tachyon_coffee.20813.desc:0 "如果说一开始这个程序是强制性实行的话，我只是把它设置成了可选择性。只要被测试者不愿意，也没办法去强迫它。这样我就能放心交给你们啦。"
tachyon_coffee.2082.desc:0 "曼城茶座从爱丽速子的手中取得了程序，随后在两位马娘还没反应过来之时将程序摧毁了，即便是多么尖端的科学家相比也无法将其还原吧。\n“茶座……”爱丽速子似乎有什么话要说，但是嘟了嘟嘴，又不说了。\n“它太危险了，我不希望速子或是代表政府的你们得到它，请原谅。”曼城茶座一脸决绝，似乎有要同归于尽之勇气。\n程序已经被摧毁了，就算是想要苛责几句，也已经无济于事了。"
tachyon_coffee.20831.desc:0 "在爱丽速子与曼城茶座还未反应之时，记录官迅速从腰上取出手枪并朝两人射击。\n记录官从最开始的任务便是监视并协助她们，但必要时刻也可以采取一定措施来达成目的，现在显然是这种时刻。\n她所携带的是政府特制的手枪，所使用的也是不会置人于死地的子弹，记录官所瞄准的都是非致命部位，虽然并不致命，但剧烈的疼痛也能令她们两个在地上躺上一会儿了。\n记录官迅速走到爱丽速子身旁，从她的手中取走“导师”程序后便离开了。"
tachyon_coffee.20832.desc:0 "在我们的记录官准备从腰间取出手枪射向两人时，曼城茶座仿佛受到启示一般，迅速推开了爱丽速子，并俯下身子，以极快的速度冲向记录官，在记录官还未来得及调转枪口时一击肘击攻向记录官的手臂，致使手枪脱手，随后跟进一击鞭腿将其打倒在地。\n记录官被击倒了，这一切似乎发生在一刻之间，爱丽速子也有些恍惚地看着曼城茶座，有些不明所以。也没等爱丽速子缓过来，曼城茶座便迅速拉着她的手离开了。同时带走的还有“导师”程序。"
tachyon_coffee.2091.desc:0 "我本以为你会信守承诺，没想到你们还是做出了这样卑劣的事情……你会后悔的"
tachyon_coffee.2092.desc:0 "从前我一直不相信我偶然会出现的“启示”，但没想到这次多亏了它反而救了我们一命，这让我对它深信不疑。请等待吧，等待着你违背契约精神的惩罚。"
tachyon_coffee.2100.desc:0 "速子与茶座近几年不断为我们提供来自未知星系的勘测信息，而上交的汇报，其中内容也都极具传奇色彩，就像是古早的浪漫史诗一样。\n当然，接收这些汇报的审查人员也清楚，这其中的一部分肯定有着爱丽速子的执笔，她总是喜欢在一些细节上加以夸大，这也多少令审查人员哭笑不得。\n我们想着，现在可以试着联系她们一下，询问她们是否有暂时放下在外勘测的工作，回国继续进行科研工作。我们可以告诉她们，我们现在有多需要她们的才能。但我们对她们是否会放弃自己的兴趣抱有疑虑。"
tachyon_coffee.2101.desc:0 "不知道现在在你们那么现在几点了，总之早上好，你来找我有什么事吗？我的时间安排可很紧。"
tachyon_coffee.21010.desc:0 "好的，我在等你们的最终决定"

tachyon_coffee.21022.desc:0 "随着著名科学家爱丽速子的回归，整个学术界哗然。而更令人惊讶的是，政府在几天之后钦定爱丽速子为国家科研理事会的永久主席，这更是激起了一阵热议。\n一些曾排挤他人并刻意拒绝通过别的科学家的改革提议的学阀集体们在爱丽速子上任之后迅速化鸟兽散。\n之后爱丽速子针对科研理事会做出诸多改革，吸引着越来越多的青年科学家的加入。我国的整体科研水平也在逐步增加。"

tachyon_coffee.21103.desc:0 "前国立特雷森大学外国语学部的前语言学教授曼城茶座在近日被政府宣布就任国家的外交总长。\n得益于其出色的语言天赋与巧妙的演讲与话术能力，我们国家在对外的话语权中愈来愈大，越来越多的国家来与我们签订一系列的互惠条约，这也都多亏了曼城茶座在外交事物上的兢兢业业。\n我们相信，在未来我们也将面对更多外交上的困境，这一切我们也要仰仗曼城茶座的能力了呀。"
tachyon_coffee.2021.desc:0 "爱丽速子安稳诞生在爱丽家中，据说她上面几辈是个颇有来头的血脉，但自幼早熟的她对此并不感兴趣，她将自己的生活中心完全放置在了一些外人看来颇具奇幻色彩的科学研究上，但也因此落下了许多生活常识，很多时候都是由来自同家的爱丽数码帮衬、陪伴着，终于是没有落下什么毛病，平平安安的上学去了。但在数码一直以来的宠溺下，她倒是愈发不好处理生活上的事情了。\n速子在言行举止上，有着一些令周围人感到不快的问题。幼时的她并不太在意别人的感受，譬如说会在教授讲课时公开指出教授讲课时的错误，不留一点儿情面，常常让教授们下不了台；或者说也不太在意环境，放现在说便是不太有情商、不太会读空气。所以绝大部分与她交涉过的人，先是会肯定她在学术与科研上的天赋与成就，但之后也会尖锐地指出她毫无礼貌的个性。\n而这一点直到她开始长大，并且遇到曼城茶座之后才逐渐改善过来。尽管她仍保留了不少“潇洒”的性格。\n速子是在十四岁的时候便进入了国立特雷森大学深造，跳过了初等部与高等部。在特雷森学园与赛马娘协会都来询问她是否有意向成为一名赛马娘时，她答复道：\n“抱歉，我想为更具理想色彩与为了我们未来一切的领域奋斗，而不是到赛场上跑一下，然后再到台上唱几段，跳几下。并且我预计着自己不会在大学里学太久，一些急迫地事情仍等着我去解决。”\n她拒绝的原因确实如上面所说，同时也有着自己身体的问题。她很早时候便了解自己腿部的毛病，知道自己即便作为赛马娘出道了，凭着实力或侥幸赢得了几场比赛，但也仅此而已了，她的赛事生涯注定不会太长，也不会太过于闪耀，只会留给大家一段对“如果”的遐想。所以她便干脆不浪费这样的时间了，全身心投入学习与研究中。因此她也做出了妥协。在科学之外，她仍学习着医学方面的知识，打算着今后为赛马娘的医疗医护事业做出自己的贡献。她希望像自己这样先天条件不好的马娘也能够持久且愉快地跑下去；希望遭遇挫折伤病的马娘也能得到医治，不会因伤病也早早结束生涯，或结束生命。\n这是她与曼城茶座交心之后所说的话。在她那副学者似的自傲下仍隐藏着理想主义者的光辉。\n这已是她的理想之一。\n她有着以自己学识征服星空的野望，也有着专注于大地上肉身的探索。"
tachyon_coffee.2022.desc:0 "在爱丽速子如饥似渴地学习着自己领域的知识时，大学里也来了一位新面孔。\n曼城茶座最开始是赛马娘出身，初高中都在特雷森学院学习着，并且在经典赛事上跑了三年，得到了些不错的成就，但最后得了些腿部的毛病，到底是没有跑下去了。在退役之后，她来到了国立中央特雷森大学深造，攻读语言学。\n曼城茶座选择语言学倒是没有什么特别的原因，她对于理科的学习是不太精通且不敏感的，所以便选了个文科专业，一来二去便到这里来了。虽然茶座有着“随便一选”的意味，但她仍专心致志地学习着，并且由于在这方面的知识有着一定的天赋，她很早就申请了提前毕业，往更高的研究程度学习去了。\n速子与茶座的相遇便是在这个时期。\n在国立中央特雷森科学院的休息大堂，各领域的教授与研究员都会在这里交流意见，因此，在这平平无奇的休息室里不知道发生过多少次理念的交锋与灵感的迸发。\n曼城茶座偶尔会到这里来独自吃午饭。这里有点像另类的图书馆，因为这里坐着的人的大脑里装着不知道有多少知识，不知道要写多少书才能记录下来；但这里没有图书馆那么安静，若是你恰巧碰到了一些学者们在这里激烈进行理念碰撞的话。\n而爱丽速子有时也会拿着一块纸板，到这里来找研究助手。上面歪歪扭扭地写着些字，还有些简陋的涂鸦，像是出自幼儿园小孩儿之手。那张纸板上的字也很直白地写着：\n“我需要一个懂古代语言且能够进行破译的助手。”\n她并没有提报酬方面的问题，而且在邀请人进入项目时，她的态度倒是诚恳的，但用语却不太令人想要与之共事。有次她曾对某位语言学研究员邀请道：\n“打扰你一下，我看你是学语言学的，既然你能够站在这里那么就一定有着怎么样的过人之处。我想请问你有没有想要深入对它进行钻研呢？虽然你可能会在某个项目上深陷瓶颈，但我一定不会嫌弃你的愚蠢，因为我已经大概学会如何宽容对待在头脑上比自己稍微逊色的人了......”\n总之是类似这样的话。\n古代语言在这里并不算太热门，因为大多会被外派去某处进行考古作业。这其中能力出众的也除了那些老前辈们，便只剩下茶座了，因此速子也曾邀请过茶座，开头便使用了上头的话术，但是在其中却增加了不少对茶座成就的赞赏，似乎在经历了数次失败之后稍微做好了一些功课。听完后茶座倒没有像别人一样离开或赶她走，她对这个与她年纪相仿的科学家充满着好奇，便问她：\n“你想要找这样一个助手来帮你破译什么呢？而且为什么突然想要去钻研一些老东西？我以为你们可都够新的，都去整一些新奇玩意儿。”\n速子沉默着，把挂在脖子上的招人牌子给摘下来了，随后说道：\n“不知道，可能是心血来潮。我觉得我迟早有一天是要离开这里的，待在这里和一些老家伙们搞着什么学术政治会令我厌烦的，而且老实说没什么前途......外面可能会有着我期待的事物，但它是什么呢？我不太清楚，所以我希望找到一个同伴与我一起找到这个东西。不过这或许意味着我们将脱离国家、脱离家庭、脱离......反正有什么就会脱离什么吧！”\n茶座笑了起来，觉得她并没有别人评价说的那样有着太过早熟且无组织无纪律的模样，相反却有着一点儿像孩子似的幼稚与莫名其妙。茶座便回复她说：\n“如果我是你，我就会说，‘但我们还拥有着彼此。’”\n那之后，茶座便加入了速子所在的个人研究小组。\n而实际上，茶座回复的话在那时多少带着些暧昧的味道，两人在之后回忆起这段记忆时，都不免觉得当时的自己真是有些大胆。"
tachyon_coffee.2023.desc:0 "速子与茶座一直作为一对奇妙的组合活跃于科学院中。她们鲜少参与前沿的学术研究，只是在自己的专属实验室里做着自己的研究，有时是个人的，有时是一起的；她们总会闷在里面埋头苦干个好几天不见人影。\n原先两人初次配合，总是闹出些小矛盾和摩擦，但碍于各自的需求，哪怕是速子这种满嘴攻击性的话的人，也只会抱怨几句之后便不再继续说下去了。而为了更好的跟进研究进度与培养作为搭档的默契，茶座也在某次项目结束之后搬入了速子的屋子，开始了同居的生活。一开始速子是有些排斥的，她可不想有个谁突然出来管着她。但一来二去，不知用了多少理由，到底是住进来了。\n但虽说是同居舍友，茶座却有着些又当爹又当妈的感觉。像是速子她的那张不饶人的嘴、个人的生活习惯与饮食习惯，她都得好好的把她矫正过来才好。因此，她时常想过自己搬进来是不是一件未经深思熟虑的事情，但在次次看到速子她熬了几天夜才勉强完成的研究成果，脸上那副孩子似的笑容，若是离开了，就轻易看不见了。\n时常她能看到速子带着些怀旧的样子，对着自己说：\n“你就像数码一样。”\n后来茶座才知道这是对她在照顾自己方面的最高评价。\n这样一来二去又是好几个四季。\n随着两人的研究项目完成的越多，她们之间的默契也有了肉眼可见的成长。她们的行动不再说长句，一个动作或眼神，或只是几个字词便可完全阐述。爱丽速子因为在赛马娘医疗技术以及器械革新上做出杰出贡献，她被科研理事会的成员推举进国立特雷森大学医学部做部长；曼城茶座因速子到了大学里去，为了协助她，便也申请调过去了，去做了一名语言学教授。\n教导过爱丽速子的讲师教授们听到她要回校任教，一时间有些不知所措了。她们在授课时或多或少都受到过速子的尖锐评价，因此对于她，一向是抱着两面性来看待的。\n但这回返校的爱丽速子却并不带着她小时的那副桀骜不驯，难以管教的一面；教授们在与她交谈时感受到了她的温文尔雅与谦卑，仿佛站在她们面前的真是某位温和的学者，而不是那位满嘴攻击性的爱丽速子；她们简直不敢相信，面前的速子与几年前的她竟是同一个人。\n爱丽速子并没有变，但她把自己的那副自傲隐藏在了最深处，只有在面对茶座时才能很好的展现出来。但那副谦卑却并非是装出来的，这是在与茶座相处时不自觉的培养出来的，她自己也觉得矛盾呢。\n速子也茶座即使到了大学里工作，她们也总和在科学院时那样一有时间便会腻在一起，那马尾巴都恨不得要缠着对方，不让她离开自己半步似的。"
tachyon_coffee.2024.desc:0 "她们的学生总是问她们：\n“老师，你们什么时候结婚呀？”\n这些话总是令她们两个听得面红耳赤，不知道该说些什么。这种空挡更是给了那些学生们可趁之机，学生们在试着撮合她们上面，不知比自己的学业努力多少倍。\n这种话一多了，两人里的某一个也总会往这方面想，这里这么想的便是曼城茶座了。她有时趁着休息时候，也问速子：\n“你是怎么想的呢？”\n速子大概知道她想问些什么，但是不做声，捣鼓着自己的东西，试着蒙混过去。末了实在撑不住了，知道自己总得说些什么，才说了句：\n“我们是搞学问的......弄这些不好......影响......”\n茶座知道她还有着些顾虑，也不逼她，只是温柔地望着她，双手握着她的一只手，似乎把所有感情都倾注在上面似的。\n之后一些日子，不知茶座是用了什么法子，终于是让她应下来了。结婚的日子是定在了她们初次相遇的时候，当时速子挂着招人的纸板，而她们也在当时并不算特别认真的“私定了终身”。因此她们一致觉得这是个值得纪念的日子。\n婚礼的当日，速子像是深闺里的小怨妇似的，嘟着嘴。几名化妆师小心翼翼地给速子上着妆，穿上婚纱。虽然她们说定速子做头，茶座做小；但今天婚礼是反过来的，速子是“妻位”，而茶座是“郎位”。\n茶座已经准备妥当了，她把自己的长头发束了个漂亮的马尾，身上穿着合身的黑色西装，搭配着茶座的气质，倒也真像个巨企董事长，或者是个黑手党的教父。有着一种干练凌厉的风采；另一边的速子则是终于穿好了婚纱，这在她的感觉里极不适应，恨不得速速结束了赶紧脱下来。但茶座可由不得她，她可想好好的记下这时的速子的模样，这可是可以铭记一生的记忆。\n待到两人要宣誓，互说愿意时，速子说道：\n“这是为了你还能给我做饭......所做出的伟大妥协。”\n茶座打着趣，回复说：\n“你要是不认真说一句，我就逃婚了。”\n速子似乎真的有些慌张起来，左顾右盼着，最后好不容易才望向茶座的眼睛，嗫嚅地说了句：\n“我爱你......”"
