When she saw us, she did not stop swallowing food, but nodded gently and bobbed her ears happily.§!\n\n“唔唔，你好”\n\n§YQuickly swallow the last bite of food, and then say hello.§!"

But in fact, her own work, her research partnership with Mejiro McQueen, and the National Traincent often invited her to give classes and lectures. These work schedules are crowding out the time she doesn't have. In short, she continued to do so, and never missed a class or lecture.§!\n"Oh, President, come to the institute at such a leisure, do you want to give some deadly research instructions, or simply inspect the work?"\n§YAgnes Tachyon stood there, laughing mockingly.
