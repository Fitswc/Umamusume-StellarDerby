origin_uma_candleoff: "Burnt out embers"

origin_uma_candleoff_desc: "The stars are not as warm as we imagine, it will tear us into pieces of smile.\nOur gentleness and trust have been rewarded with the blood and the cries of our people.\nThe grassland running in the sunset is scorched, and only the smoke and dust that never dissipates fills the head.\nThe stars were nowhere to be seen, only the battleships that obscured the sun.\nThe survivors survived, guerrilla in the wilderness of their homeland, and then one day, years later, we found a ray of life.\nWe are surrounded not only by the civilisations that have brutalized us, but also by two equally powerful ones. They began to fight for our territory, and when the defenders were empty, we finally captured a starbase.\nWe don't lose to them, we lose to ourselves. After this, there is no kindness.\nBy the time they finally notice our struggle, it will be too late.\nWe should be grateful that they have taught us the laws of this universe, and we respond with destruction.\nIn the midst of the war, we were born again."
